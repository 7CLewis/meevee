## Project Description:
Meevee (My Extra Efficient Virtual Event Executor) will be a Google Chrome plugin targeted at students which will open scheduled Zoom classes automatically based on Zoom links and schedule information provided by the user. 

## Building
This project can be run in the browser or as a Chrome extension.
First, ensure all modules are installed
```
$ npm ci
```
To run the project in the browser, execute 
```
$ ng serve
```

To run the project as a chrome extension, execute

```
Then in the Chrome Extensions manager page, load unpacked the `dist/meevee` folder. 
(Note: Do not run `ng build` directly. That will delete the manifest and favicon from the dist folder.)
